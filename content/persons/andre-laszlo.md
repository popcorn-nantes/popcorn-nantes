I'm a **Swedish developer** with experience from a variety of
industries. I have worked as a consultant, at IT giants and small
startups.

I get up to speed quickly, so I'm happy to do work with existing sites
and systems - but I also like starting things and creating things from
scratch. My focus is always to **solve problems**.

Here are some of the things I have worked on the last two years:

- Technical co-founder of [mypapermag](https://mypapermag.com) — A personalized printed magazine
- [Prelaunch campaign](https://github.com/andrelaszlo/jho-launcher) for [Jho](https://jho.fr) (I did not make their current site).
- Entrepreneur in Residence at [Imagination Machine](https://imagination-machine.com)
- Search and storage systems at [Meltwater](https://meltwater.com)
- I've been part of the selection committee for the technical track of [Web2day](https://web2day.co) 2018 and 2019

My language preferences are Python and JavaScript but I have worked
professionally with a lot of languages, frameworks and technologies so
please ask me if you're working with something unusual (Perl, Erlang,
Elixir, ...).

My French is not at a professional level yet, but I'm working on it!
